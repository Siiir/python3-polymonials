The program was designed to work with algebraical expressions.  For now, it has one builtin object – polynomial.

It can find its use in polynomial calculations and mathematical analysis. For example:
	computing polynomial value for any given complex number (x∈C)
	finding zero places **
	ploting graphs**
	finding deriviative
	all operations (+ - *) except for division which isn't implemented yet
**implemented only for polynomials of 2 to 0 degree

It is also capable of making many operations on polynomials of all degrees, including:
	moving their terms left, right
	changing/adding terms
	can concatenate with other [polynomial/list] objects
	has most properties of the list object, but is indexed from  n to 0, where n equals its degree.
	and other...
